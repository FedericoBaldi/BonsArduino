# BonsArduino

Hi everyone I just want to share a little project that I've made.
I wanted to monitor my bonsai tree and see data on a website.
I used Arduino and some cheap sensors.

### Materials
- Arduino Uno
- Module Wi-Fi ESP8266
- Temperature and Umidity Sensor AM2302 DHT22
- Brightness Sensor, a normal fotodiod
- Soil moisture Sensor
- For power autonomy I used a powerbank ~12000mAh
- BreadBoard
- Obviusly wires, jumpers
- An Access Point where to connect

### What to do
- You just need to download dht library and include it in Arduino libray folder.
- You have to do the wiring on the BreadBoard by connect Arduino and the various sensors. I let an image about wiring.
- You have to make an easy website that can handle your data. Mine is hosted free by altervista.com
