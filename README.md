# BonsArduino

Hi everyone I just want to share a little project that I've made. I wanted to monitor my bonsai tree and see data on a website. <br>I used an Arduino and some cheap sensors.

### Materials
- Arduino Uno
- Module Wi-Fi ESP8266
- Temperature and Umidity Sensor AM2302 DHT22
- Brightness Sensor, a normal photodiode
- Soil moisture Sensor
- Powerbank for power autonomy. Mine is ~12000mAh
- BreadBoard
- Obviusly wires, jumpers
- Access Point where to connect

### What to do
- You just need to download dht library and include it in Arduino library folder.
- You have to do the wiring on the BreadBoard by connect Arduino and the various sensors. I will let an image about wiring soon.
- You have to make an easy website that can handle your data. Mine is hosted free by altervista.com

### The Code
- You can find all files in the project folder.

I hope you will enjoy.
